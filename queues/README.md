# Queues

A queue is first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that can be used
to maintain data in an organized way.

This data structure is commonly implemented in one of two ways:

1. Array
2. Linked List


## How it works?

When data is added to the queue, it is tacked onto the end, and so if an element needs to be removed,
the element at the front is the only element that can legally be removed.

There are only two operations that may be legally performed on a queue:

1. **Enqueue**  - Add a new element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**  - Remove the oldest element from the front of the queue.
