# Stacks

A stack is last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that can be used
to maintain data in an organized way.

This data structure is commonly implemented in one of two ways:

1. Array
2. Linked List


## How it works?

When data is added to the stack, it sits "on top", and so if an element needs to be removed,
the most recently added element is the only element that can legally be removed.

There are only two operations that may be legally performed on a stack:

1. **Push**     - Add a new element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**      - Remove the most recently-added element from the top of the stack.
